Inspired by true events, <em>Take Me</em> is the story of Shelly, a woman trapped by the trauma of a husband in a coma and the chaos that followed. Looking for solace, she finds herself pulled in to the realm of wild alien conspiracy theories. Voices from the sky tell her the answer to all her problems is to build an alien themed amusement park in Roswell, New Mexico.</p><p><em>Take Me</em> is a comic fantasia, a story about having faith in a world where there are more questions than answers.

FW, BW is looking to change what, and how, we teach each other to ensure no measure of confidence is overlooked or untapped. It is our responsibility to arm ourselves with information, physical preparation and self-defense strategies to protect our basic human right to live. We recognize that too many womxn experience threats to their safety at some point in their lives, and predatory attacks transcend age, gender, race &amp; culture.</p><p><strong>Incorporating Strength-Training:</strong> Learning the fundamentals of self-defense is important, and being physically able to complete the movements is paramount. Strength-training not only improves your body’s ability to move about in the world, it improves one’s mind-body connection which directly sharpens one’s awareness and intuition throughout the day.
